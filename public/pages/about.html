<h1>Clark's Wildthings Farm</h1>

<blockquote>
  When we contemplate the whole globe as ne greate dewdrop,
  stripped and dotted with continents and islands, flying through
  space with other stars all singing and shining together as one,
  the whole universe appears in infinite storm of beauty.
  -- John Muir
